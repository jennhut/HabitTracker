# Habit Tracker

> Assignment 06 of 10 · Capability Engineer Starter Program

A personal tool to define recurring habits, check them off daily, and see streaks and a weekly completion rate.

- **Primary user:** You. This is a tool you would actually use.
- **Concept this teaches:** Computed-on-read fields (streak length, completion rate) versus stored fields, and how much of that logic belongs in SQL versus Python.
- **Envelope:** 4 ± 1 entities · 3 user stories · 3 ± 1 screens · one aggregation report · one state transition

## How to use this repository

This is a **template repository**. Click "Use this template" on GitHub (or run `gh repo create <your-name> --template SSI-Strategy/ce-06-habit-tracker --public`) to make your own copy. Then clone it and work in your copy — not in the template itself.

The template ships with an empty but runnable backend (FastAPI + SQLite + uv) and frontend (Vite + React + TypeScript). Everything else is for you to design with your agent, phase by phase, following [the starter workflow](https://ssi-strategy.github.io/ce-starter/#workflow).

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- Node.js 20+ LTS

### Run the skeleton

**Terminal 1 — backend**

```
cd backend
uv sync
uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

Visit `http://localhost:8000/docs` to see the OpenAPI UI. The only endpoint is `GET /api/health`. The rest is for you to design.

**Terminal 2 — frontend**

```
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:5173`. The Vite dev server proxies `/api/*` to the backend on `:8000`.

## What you will build

A personal tool to define recurring habits, check them off daily, and see streaks and a weekly completion rate.

The deliverables are the same as every assignment in the starter program — they are defined by the workflow, not by the app:

- `docs/01-brief.md` — a one-page brief covering user, three user stories, nouns, verbs
- `docs/02-data-model.md` — the data model as a markdown document, not SQL
- `backend/schema.sql`, `backend/seed.sql`, a running SQLite database
- A FastAPI backend with OpenAPI docs at `http://localhost:8000/docs`
- A React + Vite frontend at `http://localhost:5173`
- `docs/06-retro.md` and a 2–3 minute screen recording of the final demo

---

## Before you start — the three decisions

Your Phase-1 brainstorm must lock these down. Do not start the data model before all three have an answer.

1. What is a habit — just a name, or does it carry a target (e.g., 'three times per week')?
2. What is a check-in — a boolean per day, or can it carry a count or a note?
3. What is a 'streak' — consecutive days, or consecutive expected days? Your answer changes the aggregation.

## Deliberately out of scope

- No reminders or scheduling.
- No multi-user.
- No calendar integration.

## Phase-by-phase

Each phase below shows the generic prompt from the starter library plus a hint specific to this assignment. Adapt the prompt; keep the structure.

### Phase 1 — Brainstorm the use case

**Artifact:** `docs/01-brief.md`

Sharpen the idea with an LLM until you can name the user, three user stories, the nouns the app tracks, and the verbs the user performs.

**Prompt:**

```
I want to build a small local web application. Help me sharpen the idea by asking me questions. I will answer. After five rounds of questions, summarise what we have agreed on as a one-page brief covering: the user, the three core user stories, the key nouns (things the app tracks), and the key verbs (things the user can do).
```

**For this assignment:** Pick one habit you actually want to track. Use that habit in every user story. Abstract habits make vague apps.

### Phase 2 — Design the data model

**Artifact:** `docs/02-data-model.md`

Every screen, API call, and query descends from this. Get it right before any code exists.

**Prompt:**

```
Read docs/01-brief.md. Based on the nouns listed there, propose a data model for a SQLite database. For each entity, give me: its fields, each field's type and whether it is required, the primary key, any foreign keys, and any uniqueness or check constraints. Show the model as a markdown document, not SQL. Explain every foreign key in one sentence. Then list any ambiguities you had to resolve and why.
```

**For this assignment:** Decide whether a streak is a stored field or a derived one. Derived is the right answer; make sure your model reflects that.

### Phase 3 — Build the database

**Artifact:** `backend/schema.sql + app.db`

Turn the model into real SQLite. Constraints fail loudly and expose every ambiguity the model left behind.

**Prompt:**

```
Using docs/02-data-model.md as the source of truth, generate backend/schema.sql for SQLite. Include every primary key, foreign key, uniqueness constraint, and check constraint from the model. Add created_at and updated_at where the model specifies them. Then generate backend/seed.sql with 3-5 rows per table covering the happy path and at least one edge case per user story. Finally, wire the schema to apply automatically on backend startup if the database file does not exist.
```

**For this assignment:** Seed a month of check-ins with at least one missed day, so the streak logic has something to break on.

### Phase 4 — Design and build the API

**Artifact:** `http://localhost:8000/docs`

Design the endpoints as a markdown table first. Build them second. The OpenAPI spec at /docs is the real deliverable.

**Prompt:**

```
Based on the verbs in docs/01-brief.md and the entities in docs/02-data-model.md, propose a REST API. For each endpoint, give me: the method, the path, the request body shape, the response shape, and which user story it serves. Do not write code yet. Return a markdown table.

Once I approve the table, implement these endpoints in FastAPI under backend/app/. Use Pydantic models for every request and response. Use the stdlib sqlite3 module. All routes must be prefixed with /api. Add a GET /api/health that returns {"status": "ok"}. Make sure every endpoint appears in the OpenAPI docs at /docs with a clear summary and a populated example.
```

**For this assignment:** Return streak and completion-rate in the GET /habits response, computed on the fly. Do not store them.

### Phase 5 — Build the frontend

**Artifact:** `http://localhost:5173`

Generate TypeScript types from the OpenAPI spec. Design each screen in markdown. Then build.

**Prompt:**

```
Generate TypeScript types for every request and response in the backend OpenAPI spec at http://localhost:8000/openapi.json. Put them in frontend/src/api/types.ts. Then write a thin client.ts in the same directory with one function per endpoint. Every function must use the generated types — no any.

Then, for each of the three user stories in docs/01-brief.md, propose a screen: what the user sees, what they can do, what state changes after each action. Return a short markdown brief per screen. Do not write components yet.

Once I approve the screens, implement them using React and plain CSS. Use the typed client for every API call. Keep each screen to one route. Show loading and error states for every request. Add one Vitest test per screen that renders it with a mocked client.
```

**For this assignment:** The grid of days is the screen. Spend your design time there.

### Phase 6 — Integrate and verify

**Artifact:** `docs/06-retro.md + a 2–3 minute screen recording`

The app is done when a stranger can use it to accomplish the user stories.

**Prompt:**

```
Let's verify. Kill both servers. From the repo root, run `uv sync` in backend/, then `npm install` in frontend/, then start both. Walk me through each user story in the browser. If any story fails or any unexpected error appears, tell me which phase's artifact needs to change — do not patch in place.

Then help me write docs/06-retro.md: what surprised me, what I would do differently, where I pushed back on the agent and why. Include the full prompt log from this session.
```

**For this assignment:** Check off yesterday and confirm your streak updates. If it does not, the computed-on-read promise is broken somewhere.

## When you are done

- All three user stories complete end-to-end in the browser with no console errors.
- `uv sync && uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000` starts the backend clean.
- `npm install && npm run dev` starts the frontend clean.
- Demo recording saved as `docs/demo.mp4` (or similar) and referenced in the retro.
- Retro in `docs/06-retro.md` with your prompt log.
